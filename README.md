# Deutsche Bahn Data Mining Challenge

[Project Webpage](https://liuyumaosid.wixsite.com/resume-of-yumao-liu/dbmachinelearning)

## Overview

This repository contains code and tools for the Deutsche Bahn Data Mining Challenge (Oct 2021 – Jan 2022), focusing on systemic delay analysis, predictive modeling, and actionable insights for large-scale railway operations.

**Main Contributions:**
- Analyzed complex railway network datasets to uncover delay patterns.
- Developed a neural network-based dispatching model for delay reduction, using PCA for feature selection.
- Provided interpretable visualizations and practical optimization suggestions to support efficient scheduling.
