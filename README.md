## 🧪 Industrial Background

This work was conducted for the **Deutsche Bahn Data Mining Challenge** (Dec 2021 – Feb 2022) in cooperation with **DB Cargo**, Europe’s largest rail-freight operator. With the growing deployment of GNSS-enabled dataloggers across freight wagons, DB Cargo collects massive volumes of raw sensor data, including positional traces, shock events, and dynamic train compositions.

Focusing on **systemic delay analysis, predictive modeling, and actionable insights**, the project applies data mining and machine learning to extract patterns from this complex, unstructured data. The resulting models support **proactive dispatch planning**, **fleet health monitoring**, and **cost-efficient scheduling**—key elements for optimizing large-scale railway operations.



**Main Contributions:**
- Analyzed complex railway network datasets to uncover delay patterns.
- Developed a neural network-based dispatching model for delay reduction, using PCA for feature selection.
- Provided interpretable visualizations and practical optimization suggestions to support efficient scheduling.
